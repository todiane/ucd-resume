## Live Website

Live deployed project link is [Diane Corriette Portfolio](https://todiane.github.io/ucd-resume/)


This is the Code Institute student template for UCD Resume. Created on 21 August 2023.  

The training takes us through how to create a resume website using html, css and Bootstrap 4.6.

I updated my website to showcase my own experience and training plus provide links to my portfolio projects and social media.

Happy coding!
